# Nanyx Parser

A parser for the Nanyx programming language built with FParsec.

## Features

Currently supports parsing:

- **Module declarations**: `module ModuleName`
- **Value definitions**: `def identifier = expression`
- **Literals**:
  - Strings: `"Hello world"`
  - Integers: `42`
  - Floats: `3.14159`
  - Booleans: `true`, `false`
- **Identifiers**: Variable references like `someValue`
- **Function calls**: `println("Hello")`, `add(1, 2)`, nested calls
- **Lambda expressions**: 
  - Standard: `{ x -> x }`, `{ x, y -> add(x, y) }`, `{ 42 }`
  - **Shorthand lambdas**:
    - Binary operators: `{ * }` → `{ x, y -> x * y }`
    - Unary operations: `{ * 2 }` → `{ x -> x * 2 }`, `{ > 10 }` → `{ x -> x > 10 }`
    - Property access: `{ .name }` → `{ x -> x.name }`
- **Pipe operator**: `\`
  - Simple: `x \f` → `f(x)`
  - With arguments: `x \f(y, z)` → `f(x, y, z)`
  - Chaining: `x \f \g \h` → `h(g(f(x)))`
- **Binary operators**: `++` (concatenation), `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`
  - With correct precedence (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction)
- **Parenthesized expressions**: `(1 + 2) * 3`
- **Whitespace handling**: Flexible whitespace and newlines

```

## Prerequisites

To **run** a published `nanyx` binary (from a GitHub release or a `Compiler` workflow artifact)
nothing needs to be installed: it is self-contained, and the Wasmtime engine that executes
programs is embedded in it. Supported platforms are `win-x64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`,
`osx-x64` and `osx-arm64`. On Linux and macOS, `chmod +x nanyx` after unpacking.

To **build** the compiler from source you need the
[.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0); `dotnet --version` should print
`10.x`. The build restores everything else from NuGet, including the `Wasmtime` package that ships
the native engine for every platform above, so no separate Wasmtime, wat2wasm or wasm runtime
install is needed.

## Building

```powershell
cd compiler
dotnet build Nyx.Compiler.slnx
```

## Running Tests

```powershell
cd compiler
dotnet test Nyx.Compiler.slnx
```

All 56 tests should pass:
- **Unit tests** (49): Literal parsing, identifiers, function calls, lambdas (standard & shorthand), pipe operator, binary operators, whitespace, errors
- **Integration tests** (7): Full .nyx file parsing from `testdata/` directory
  - `literals.nyx`: String, int, float, boolean literals
  - `function-calls.nyx`: Various function call patterns
  - `lambdas.nyx`: Lambda expressions with different parameter counts
  - `shorthand-lambdas.nyx`: Shorthand lambda syntax (binary ops, unary ops, property access)
  - `piping.nyx`: Pipe operator usage (simple, with args, chaining)
  - `binary-operators.nyx`: Arithmetic, comparison, and equality operators
  - `comprehensive.nyx`: Mix of all features
  - `binary-operators.nyx`: Arithmetic, comparison, and equality operators
  - `comprehensive.nyx`: Mix of all features

Run specific test files:
```powershell
dotnet test --filter "Parse literals.nyx"
```

## Continuous integration and releases

The `Compiler` workflow (`.github/workflows/compiler.yml`) builds and tests the solution on
Linux and Windows for every pull request and push to `main` that touches `compiler/`, and
publishes a self-contained `nanyx` executable for each supported platform as a workflow artifact.

To cut a release, bump `<Version>` in `Nanyx.Compiler.Cli/NanyxCompiler.Cli.csproj` and merge.
When the workflow on `main` finds no `compiler/<version>` tag for that version, it creates the tag
and attaches the binaries it just built and tested to a GitHub release; nothing is rebuilt. Pushes
that leave the version unchanged release nothing. (The VS Code extension is released the same way:
bump `version` in `extension/package.json` and merge.)

## Running programs

The parser, type checker, WASM backend and runtime are libraries; the `nanyx` CLI is the only
executable. It takes a target and a `.nyx` file:

| Target  | What it does                                                                 |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `run`   | Compiles the file and runs it on the embedded Wasmtime engine                |
| `wasm`  | Emits WebAssembly text (`.wat`) next to the file, or to `--out <path>`       |
| `check` | Type-checks the file and prints the inferred types                           |
| `parse` | Prints the AST                                                               |

The hello world from the docs works as written:

```nanyx
import nanyx/console

println("Hello, Nanyx!")
```

```powershell
dotnet run --project compiler/Nanyx.Compiler.Cli/NanyxCompiler.Cli.csproj -- run hello.nyx
# Hello, Nanyx!
```

`run` keeps its own output off stdout: only the program writes there, diagnostics go to stderr, and
the exit code is 0 on success, 1 when the program fails to compile or traps, and 2 for a usage error.
The project form (`module main` with `@entry def main = { ... }`) runs the same way: `@entry` marks the
definition the program starts at.

`println` comes from the standard library's `nanyx/console` module (see below). A script imports it
explicitly; the module that declares `@entry` gets it implicitly, because the runtime calls the entry
point inside its `Console` context.

## The standard library

The standard library is an ordinary package named `nanyx`, written in Nanyx, with one module per file
under [`stdlib/nanyx/`](../stdlib/nanyx) at the repository root. A program imports its modules like any
other package's: `import nanyx/console`, `import nanyx/text`, or `import nanyx/text as t` for
qualified access.

It ships inside the compiler. `NanyxCompiler.fsproj` embeds every `stdlib/nanyx/*.nyx` file as a
resource named `nanyx/<module>.nyx`, so the published single-file `nanyx` binary carries the library
and reads nothing from disk. `import nanyx/<module>` reads that resource (`StandardLibrary` in
`Nanyx.Compiler/Builtins.fs`), compiles the module together with the program, and inlines its
definitions into the program the backend sees; importing a module the library does not have is a
compile error that lists the ones it does.

| Module          | What it holds                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nanyx/console` | The `Console` context (`print`, `println`) and the instance the runtime supplies to the entry point |
| `nanyx/result`  | `proc`, the result workflow: in `proc { ... }`, `try x` continues with the payload of `#some` or gives back any other tag (the block's type collects them), and `return x` is `#some(x)` |
| `nanyx/text`    | `length`, `substring`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `indexOf`, `lastIndexOf`, `contains`, `count`, `removePrefix`, `removeSuffix`, `toUpper`, `toLower`, `trim`, `trimStart`, `trimEnd`, `isEmpty`, `isBlank`, `repeat`, `padStart`, `padEnd`, `split`, `join`, `concat`, `replace`, `lines`, `words` |

The library is written over a handful of **compiler intrinsics**: operations that cannot be expressed in
Nanyx itself, such as writing to standard output or reading a byte of a string. They are listed with
their types in one place, `Intrinsics` in `Nanyx.Compiler/Builtins.fs`, are only in scope while a
standard-library module is being checked (user code cannot call them), and are lowered by the backend
onto helper functions it emits with the module (`runtimeHelpers` in `Nanyx.Compiler.Wasm/CodeGen.fs`).
Their names all start with `__nanyx_`.

Strings are UTF-8 and this first slice of `nanyx/text` works byte by byte: `length` counts bytes,
indices and widths are byte offsets, `toUpper`/`toLower` only change ASCII letters and the trimming
functions and `words` only treat ASCII whitespace as whitespace. `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` return
`#some(index)` or `#notFound`, as the language docs specify; `replace` takes its pattern and
replacement positionally, where the docs name them. `++` (concatenation) and `==`
on strings are language operators, lowered by the backend. (The language docs describe this module as
`string` with `uppercase`/`lowercase`; the module is called `text` and the functions `toUpper`/`toLower`.)

To add a module: create `stdlib/nanyx/<name>.nyx` declaring `module <name>`, mark what it offers with
`export`, and rebuild; the glob picks it up and `import nanyx/<name>` resolves. Definitions inside a
module must be written before the definitions that use them (self-recursion is fine). Add an intrinsic
only when a function genuinely cannot be written in Nanyx: give it a name and type in `Intrinsics`, and
a WebAssembly body of the same name in `runtimeHelpers`.

## The language server

`nanyx lsp` runs a [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
server over standard input and output, so the same binary that compiles programs also serves editors.
The VS Code extension in `extension/` launches it (see `extension/README.md`); any other LSP client
can start it with `nanyx lsp` and `TransportKind.stdio`.

The server lives in `Nanyx.LanguageServer` and calls the compiler as a library: on every open and
change it runs `Compiler.compileSource` (or `Compiler.compile` for an untitled buffer) on the editor's
text, keeps the `CompileResult` in `DocumentStore`, and publishes the resulting diagnostics; hover and
go-to-definition, lenses and inlay hints read the same result, so each change is compiled once. Standard-library imports resolve because the library is
embedded in the compiler; imports by path resolve relative to the file as they do for `nanyx check`.

What it does today:

- `initialize`/`shutdown`/`exit`, full text document sync, and `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` on
  open and change (cleared on close).
- A diagnostic the compiler positions is reported from that position to the end of the identifier
  there; one the compiler cannot position is shown at the start of the file.
- A file that fails to parse gets one diagnostic for the parse error, and a compiler exception is
  reported as a diagnostic rather than taking the server down.
- `textDocument/hover` shows the inferred type of the narrowest expression under the pointer, with
  made-up type variables named `α`, `β`, ... through the Greek alphabet, a union's rest variable from
  the other end (`#some(α) | ω`), and annotation variables keeping their names, written bare as in an
  annotation (`nanyx lsp --latin-type-vars` uses `a`, `b`, ... and `z` instead), and a type alias by its
  name (`Customer`, not `(name: string)`: inference carries aliases as `TyAlias` and looks through them); on a call's function name it shows the function's type at that call (so `id` in `id(5)` is
  `int -> int`), and on a declaration's own name (a def, a parameter, a pattern variable) the type of
  what it declares. The types come from the typed module's `ExprTypes` and `CalleeTypes`, recorded by
  node during inference, and `SymbolTypes`, by symbol (see `NyxCompiler.Hover`). A file that does not type-check shows no hover.
- `textDocument/definition` goes from a value, parameter, pattern variable or import name to where it
  is declared, from the typed module's `References` and `Symbols` (see `NyxCompiler.Definition`). On a
  declaration's own name it returns that declaration. A definition in an imported source file opens that
  file; one in the standard library returns nothing, because the library is embedded in the compiler
  rather than a file the editor can open. Type names and context members are not symbols yet.
- `textDocument/codeLens` shows the inferred type above each top-level def that does not write its own
  (`α -> α` above `def id = { x -> x }`); a destructuring def's lenses say which name each is for
  (`p: int`). `textDocument/inlayHint` shows `: type` after each unannotated local def, lambda parameter
  and pattern variable. The types come from the typed module's `SymbolTypes`, leaving out its
  `AnnotatedSymbols`, and are named together a top-level def at a time, so a hint's `α` is the one in its def's
  lens (see `NyxCompiler.TypeHints`). `nanyx lsp --top-level-type-hints inlay` shows the top-level defs'
  types as inlay hints after their names instead of lenses, and `--top-level-type-hints off` shows
  neither for them (the default is `lens`). A file that does not type-check shows neither.

Find-references and completion are not implemented yet: each is one handler class in
`Nanyx.LanguageServer/Handlers/`, registered in `NanyxLanguageServer.Configure` (tracked in
[#113](https://github.com/nanyx-lang/nanyx/issues/113)).
Hover shows only types, not a name's declared signature or docs. Two compiler improvements
the server makes visible: a parse error currently drops the whole file (so one error hides
everything after it), and only some diagnostics carry a range.

The tests in `Nanyx.LanguageServer.Tests` start the server in-process and talk to it through
OmniSharp's LSP client over a pair of pipes, so they exercise the real wire protocol.

## WebAssembly (MVP)

Current WASM backend support is intentionally minimal and focused on bootstrapping:

- top-level `def` values exported as wasm functions
- lambda-backed defs compiled as wasm functions with `i32` params/result
- integer literals
- integer binary operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, comparisons)
- bare tag literals (`#ok`, `#error`, etc.) lowered to deterministic `i32` discriminants
- function calls to known module defs
- simple expression blocks with local `def` assignments (`local.set`/`local.get`)
- top-level expressions (and the `@entry` definition) run from a WebAssembly start function
- strings are pointers to length-prefixed UTF-8 bytes; `++` and `==` on strings call emitted helpers
- list literals, `++` on lists, and list patterns (`[]`, `[x, ...rest]`, `[1, y]`) over cons cells on a bump-allocated heap
- `dbg(...)` of integers and strings, and `nanyx/console`, write to stdout through WASI `fd_write`
- `dbg(#tag)` calls a host import `(import "env" "dbg_tag_<tag>" (func))`, which the runtime provides
- a function that requires a context (`[Console]`) takes its members as function-table slots; a
  `use` binding supplies them, otherwise a module-level function of the member's name does (that is how
  the runtime's `Console` reaches `@entry`)

Other language constructs will currently fail fast with an explicit "Unsupported ... for WASM MVP backend" message.

## AST Structure

```fsharp
type Literal =
    | StringLit of string
    | IntLit of int
    | FloatLit of float
    | BoolLit of bool

type Expression =
    | LiteralExpr of Literal
    | IdentifierExpr of Identifier

type Definition =
    | ValueDef of Identifier * Expression

type TopLevelItem =
    | ModuleDecl of ModuleName
    | Def of Definition

type Module = TopLevelItem list
```

## Next Steps

To extend the parser, consider adding:
- Function definitions with parameters
- Lambda expressions
- Function calls
- Operators and binary expressions
- Pattern matching
- Type annotations
- Comments (single-line `--` and multi-line `---`)
- Indentation-based blocks
- Collections (lists, records, tuples)

## Example

Input:
```nanyx
module Test

def message = "Hello world"
def count = 42
def pi = 3.14159
def flag = true
```

Parsed AST:
```fsharp
[ModuleDecl "Test";
 Def (ValueDef ("message", LiteralExpr (StringLit "Hello world")));
 Def (ValueDef ("count", LiteralExpr (IntLit 42)));
 Def (ValueDef ("pi", LiteralExpr (FloatLit 3.14159)));
 Def (ValueDef ("flag", LiteralExpr (BoolLit true)))]
```
