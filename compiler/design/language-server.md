## Summary

The editor experience for Nanyx: the language server built into the `nanyx` binary (`nanyx lsp`) and the VS Code
extension that launches it. The server calls the compiler as a library, so most of what it can offer depends on
what the compiler keeps: exact spans, resolved names and types.

## Scope

| Area | Where |
|------|-------|
| Language server | `compiler/Nanyx.LanguageServer` (C#, OmniSharp LSP) and its tests |
| VS Code extension | `extension/`: finding or downloading `nanyx`, starting the server, commands, settings |
| Syntax highlighting | `extension/syntaxes/` (TextMate grammar) |

## Where it is today

- **Diagnostics.** The server does full text sync and publishes diagnostics on open and change. A
  diagnostic with a position is shown from there to the end of the identifier; one without is shown at the start
  of the file. See [The language server](../README.md#the-language-server).
- **Hover shows inferred types** ([#120](https://github.com/nanyx-lang/nanyx/issues/120)). Inference records the
  resolved type of every expression by `NodeId` (`TypedModule.ExprTypes`, the `Types` table of the planned
  [semantic model](analyzers.md#3-the-semantic-model)), and the callee's type at each call (`CalleeTypes`), for
  the root module of a compile. Hover shows the narrowest typed expression under the pointer, or a call's
  function at that call site. On a declaration's own name (a def, a parameter, a pattern variable) it shows the
  type of what that declares, recorded by symbol (`SymbolTypes`). A desugared workflow bind or return gets a node id of its own, so the bind as
  written has no type rather than that of the rest of the workflow. Each document
  is compiled once per change and the result cached in `DocumentStore`, shared by diagnostics and hover. A
  declared signature or doc comment needs name resolution ([#98](https://github.com/nanyx-lang/nanyx/issues/98)),
  and a file that fails to type-check shows no hover.
- **Go-to-definition** for values, parameters, pattern variables and imports, from the symbols and references
  name resolution records ([#98](https://github.com/nanyx-lang/nanyx/issues/98)). A declaration's own name goes
  to itself. A definition in an imported source file opens that file; one in the standard library goes nowhere,
  since the library is embedded in the compiler, not a file on disk. Type names and context members are not
  symbols yet, so they go nowhere either.
- **Inferred types in lenses and inlay hints**, as F# tooling shows them. A top-level def that does not write
  its type gets a lens above it with its whole type; a local def, lambda parameter or pattern variable gets an
  inlay hint after its name (`: int`). The types are the declarations' `SymbolTypes`, less those inference
  records as writing their own (`AnnotatedSymbols`), and the types in one top-level def are named together, so a parameter's `α` is
  the `α` in its def's lens (see `NyxCompiler.TypeHints`). Like hover, a file that fails to type-check shows none,
  so they disappear while the file is broken and the code moves up and down as the lenses come and go; keeping
  the last good ones until the next good compile is a follow-up.
- **No find-references or completion.** Each is one handler in `Handlers/`. Find-references can read the same
  `References` table, though only of the open document's own compile.
- **A parse error hides the rest of the file**, because the parser has no error recovery.
- **The extension** highlights syntax, finds `nanyx` (setting, `PATH`, or a downloaded release) and offers
  *Download the compiler* and *Restart the language server*.

## Goals

- Errors appear as you type, at the right range, in the right file.
- Hover shows the inferred type; go-to-definition and find-references work for every name.
- Completion offers names in scope and the members of a record or imported module.
- Fixes from structured diagnostics ([#97](https://github.com/nanyx-lang/nanyx/issues/97)) appear as code actions.

## Plan

_To do._ Candidate items, not yet filed, in rough dependency order:

1. **Exact ranges.** Map diagnostic spans to LSP ranges once [#96](https://github.com/nanyx-lang/nanyx/issues/96) and [#97](https://github.com/nanyx-lang/nanyx/issues/97) land; report `code` and
   `relatedInformation`.
2. **Hover.** Inferred types are done ([#120](https://github.com/nanyx-lang/nanyx/issues/120)); declared
   signatures and docs follow from name resolution ([#98](https://github.com/nanyx-lang/nanyx/issues/98)).
3. **Go-to-definition and find-references.** From the recorded symbols and references ([#98](https://github.com/nanyx-lang/nanyx/issues/98)).
   Go-to-definition is done for values; it still needs type names and context members as symbols, and a
   way to open standard-library source (a virtual document, say).
4. **Document symbols.** The outline view, from top-level definitions.
5. **Completion.** Names in scope, then record members and module exports.
6. **Code actions.** From diagnostic fixes.
7. **Diagnostics in imported files.** Publish diagnostics for the file they belong to, not the file being edited.

## Open questions

- Incremental re-checking: is compiling the whole document on every change fast enough as programs grow?
- Should semantic tokens replace or supplement the TextMate grammar?
- Editors beyond VS Code: is `nanyx lsp` plus documented client setup enough?
