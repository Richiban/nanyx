Workflows are one of Nanyx's most distinctive features. They let libraries provide language-like constructs by rewriting a block into method calls on a builder value. This makes patterns like async/await, error chaining, and DSLs feel native.

# The builder shape

A workflow builder is a value with an `apply` function and a set of _keyword methods_ such as `yield`, `await`, `try`, or `return`. Writing a block after the builder's name:

```nanyx
someBuilder {
  -- block content
}
```

desugars to a call to the builder's `apply` function, with the block body running under `use someBuilder` so that its keyword methods are in scope:

```nanyx
someBuilder.apply({
  use someBuilder in
    -- block content
})
```

Every keyword method takes two arguments: the value the keyword was applied to, and a _continuation_ containing the rest of the block. This is the one desugaring rule for all workflows; everything else on this page is a consequence of it.

The simplest possible workflow can be illustrated with a builder that just provides a `yield` method that dumps the given value out to debug:

```nanyx
def debug = (
  apply = { body -> body() }

  @customKeywordType(#bind)
  yield = { value, continuation ->
    hostDebug(value)
    continuation()
  }
)

debug {
  yield "Debug message 1"
  yield "Debug message 2"
}
```

The block content is rewritten to nested calls to the `yield` method, each receiving the rest of the block as its continuation:

```nanyx
debug.apply({
  yield("Debug message 1", {
    yield("Debug message 2", {
      -- end of block
    })
  })
})
```

Because `yield` here calls its continuation immediately, the block runs top to bottom like ordinary sequential code. A keyword that chooses _not_ to call its continuation stops the rest of the block from running, which is how short-circuiting keywords such as `try` work (see below).

Applying a keyword to a value without parentheses, as in `yield 1` or `try f()`, is sugar reserved for workflow keywords; ordinary functions are always called with parentheses.

# Yield and collection builders

The standard `seq` builder provides `yield`, letting you build sequences with a clean syntax:

```nanyx
def numbers = seq {
  yield 1
  yield 2
  yield 3
}
```

Under the single desugaring rule this becomes:

```nanyx
seq.apply({
  yield(1, {
    yield(2, {
      yield(3, { })
    })
  })
})
```

Note that `yield` is special in that it can be used implicitly when the expression returns a value:

```nanyx
seq {
  1
  2
  3
}
```

# Async and custom keywords

Workflows can introduce custom keywords. For example, an async workflow can expose `await` by implementing a method tagged as a keyword.

```nanyx
def greetingAsync = async {
  def name = await getName()
  return "Hello, {name}"
}
```

That expands into calls on the async builder, with the binding `def name = await ...` becoming the parameter of the continuation:

```nanyx
async.apply({
  await(getName(), { name ->
    return("Hello, {name}", { })
  })
})
```

A keyword is any builder member that carries the `@customKeywordType` attribute. The attribute's argument says how the keyword's arguments are passed (see [Keyword kinds](#keyword-kinds)). There is no naming convention for keywords; `await`, `try` and `yield` are ordinary member names that happen to be marked as keywords by the builders that define them.

```nanyx
def retry = (
  apply = { body -> body() }

  @customKeywordType(#bind)
  retry = { m, continuation ->
    ...
  }
)
```

## Common keywords

| Keyword | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `yield`  | Produce a value in a collection builder |
| `await`  | Await an asynchronous operation in an async workflow |
| `try`    | Short-circuit on errors in a workflow that handles results |
| `return` | Wrap the block's final value and finish the block |
| `zero`   | The value of a block that produces no value (an `if` without `else`, or falling off the end without `return`) |
| `defer`  | Run a thunk after the rest of the block has finished |

## Keyword kinds

| Kind | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `#bind`  | The keyword takes a value and a continuation function. The workflow will call the continuation with the result of the keyword operation. |
| `#bindF` | Like bind, but a function returning the target value is passed instead of the value itself. This allows for workflows such as lazy evaluation and querying |

# Workflow keywords

Builders expose keywords by marking members with `@customKeywordType`. Attributes may be placed before a field inside a record literal:

```nanyx
def async = (
  apply = { body -> ... }

  @customKeywordType(#bind)
  await = { m, continuation ->
    ...
  }

  @customKeywordType(#bindF)
  defer = { thunk, continuation ->
    continuation()
    thunk()
  }
)
```

```nanyx
def main = {
  async {
    defer println("This runs at the end of the block")
    println("This runs first")
  }
}
```

The block above never calls `return`, so its value is the builder's `zero`.

# Error and option chaining

A workflow can provide a `try` keyword to short-circuit on errors. This is useful for `Result` or option-like chaining.

```nanyx
def getCustomer: int -> Result(Customer, #customerNotFound) = ...
def getLastOrder: Customer -> Result(Order, #orderNotFound) = ...

def lastOrderTotal: () -> Result(Money, #customerNotFound | #orderNotFound) = proc {
  def customer = try getCustomer(5)
  def order = try getLastOrder(customer)
  return order.total
}
```

`proc` is the standard library's result workflow. Its `try` calls the continuation with the payload of `#some`, and returns any `#error` value directly without calling the continuation, which is what makes the rest of the block skip. See [Option chaining](../cookbook/option-chaining) for a worked example of writing such a builder.

# Early return and defer

A workflow can also provide a `return` keyword that exits the block early, and a `defer` keyword that runs a thunk at the end of the block.

```nanyx
def main = {
  async {
    defer println("This runs at the end of the block")

    if b then return "Early exit"

    println("This runs first")
    return "Done"
  }
}
```

# Query and DSL workflows

Workflows are a natural fit for DSLs. A query builder can turn a block into a pipeline of filtering, joining, and projection steps.

```nanyx
def result = query {
  def customer = from customers
  def order = from orders
  join order.customerId == customer.customerId
  where order.total > 100
  select customer.name, order.total
}
```

Workflows are also how HTML-style builders or configuration DSLs are implemented.

# When to use workflows

- You want syntax that reads like a language feature, but is implemented in libraries.
- You need structured control flow around effects (async, retries, error handling).
- You want to provide a DSL for a narrow domain.
