Nanyx is—by default—a structurally-typed language, but sometimes a type's name matters more than its structure. To support these scenarios, Nanyx programs can define _nominal_ types using the `$` prefix. 

Nominal types have an identity that is distinct from their shape, which helps prevent accidental misuse when multiple values share a similar structure. They are very commonly used to wrap primitives—like strings and numbers—to create domain-specific types with invariants or validation.

The `$` prefix applies to `context` declarations as well as to `type` declarations. A nominal context can only be instantiated by its home module; the standard library's `$Memory` context is the main example, which is why `memory { ... }` is the only way to obtain one (see [Memory](./memory)).

# Nominal Types

A nominal type is declared like any other type, with a `$` in front of its name. The declaration gives the type a shape, but the name is what matters: two nominal types with the same shape are still different types, and a plain value of that shape is not a nominal value until it has been wrapped.

```nanyx
module email

export type $Email = string
```

## Constructors

Declaring `$Email` also declares a constructor of the same name. Applying `$Email` to a value of the underlying shape wraps it, and matching on `$Email(e)` unwraps it again:

```nanyx
def wrapped = $Email("ada@example.com")   -- $Email
def $Email(raw) = wrapped                 -- raw: string
```

For record shapes the constructor takes the record's fields by name:

```nanyx
export type $User = (
  name: string
  email: $Email
)

def user = $User(name = "Ada", email = wrapped)
```

The constructor (and the ability to clone a value) is only available inside the type's home module. Everywhere else, `$Email("...")` is a compile error. This is the whole point: the home module is the only place a nominal value can come into existence, so it is the only place that needs to uphold the type's invariants.

The usual pattern is to export a _smart constructor_—an ordinary function that validates its input and calls the real constructor only when the input is acceptable:

```nanyx
module email

export type $Email = string

export def $Email.parse: string -> Result($Email, #invalidEmail) = { value ->
  if value \contains("@") then
    #some($Email(value))
  else
    #error(#invalidEmail)
}
```

Callers in other modules obtain an `$Email` by going through `$Email.parse`; there is no other way to get one. Because the function is an [attached definition](./attached-definitions) on `$Email`, it reads naturally at the call site: `$Email.parse("ada@example.com")` or, in a pipeline, `input \$Email.parse`.

The smart constructor can return whatever is appropriate: a `Result` when there is something useful to say about why the input was rejected, an [option-like type](./option-like-types) when there isn't, or the nominal type itself when construction cannot fail.

## Assignability

Nominal types are not assignable to each other, even if their structures are identical. They are, however, assignable to their underlying shape for compatibility with existing code.

So, given the definition of `$Email` above, `$Email` is assignable to `string` but `string` is not assignable to `$Email`. In practice this means an `$Email` can be used anywhere a `string` is expected, including with every attached definition on `String`:

```nanyx
def email: $Email = ...

email.length                        -- 15
email \contains("example")          -- true
email \substring(start = 0, length = 3)  -- "ada"
email \split(on = "@")              -- ["ada", "example.com"]
```

Note that these all produce plain `string`s (or `int`s, `bool`s and so on), not `$Email`s. Taking a substring of an email address does not give you another email address, and the type system agrees.

If you wish a nominal type to be completely opaque and not assignable to its underlying shape, you can use a protected type instead.

# Protected (opaque) types

Protected types go further by hiding their structure completely outside their home module using the `private` keyword. Outside that module the type has a name and nothing else: no shape, no constructor, and none of the operations of the underlying type.

```nanyx
module ids

export type $UserId = private int

export def $UserId.new: int -> Result($UserId, #invalidUserId) = { value ->
  if value <= 0 then
    #error(#invalidUserId)
  else
    #some($UserId(value))
}
```

Outside the `ids` module, callers can pass `$UserId` values around and store them in records, but they cannot construct one directly, pattern-match on `$UserId(n)` to get at the integer, or treat the value as an `int`:

```nanyx
def a: $UserId = ...
def b: $UserId = ...

a + b              -- error: `+` is not defined for $UserId
a < b              -- error: `<` is not defined for $UserId
a \math.sqrt       -- error: $UserId is not assignable to float
a * 2              -- error: $UserId is not assignable to int
```

## Accessors

Because protected types hide their representation, the home module is also the only place that can look inside one. If callers legitimately need the underlying value—to put it in a URL, say, or write it to a database—export an accessor that returns it:

```nanyx
module ids

-- expose a read-only view of the underlying int
export def $UserId.value: $UserId -> int = { $UserId(n) -> n }
```

The accessor is a deliberate choice about which operations make sense for the type. `$UserId.value` says "you may read the number out"; it does not say "you may add two of them together", and the type system will continue to reject that.

# Choosing between them

The difference comes down to one question: is a value of your type still a value of the underlying type?

An email address is a particular kind of string. It makes sense to ask how long it is, whether it contains a substring, or what comes after the `@`. A nominal `$Email = string` captures this exactly: it cannot be confused with any other string, it can only be created by `$Email.parse`, and yet it still behaves as the string it is.

A user ID is not a particular kind of integer. It happens to be represented as one, but no operation on integers is meaningful on it: adding two user IDs together, taking the square root of one, or asking whether one is less than another are all mistakes. A protected `$UserId = private int` captures this exactly: the integer is an implementation detail, and the only things you can do with a `$UserId` are the things the `ids` module chooses to export.

Put another way:

- Use a **nominal** type when you want identity and explicit construction but the operations of the underlying shape are still meaningful on your type. Examples: `$Email`, `$Name`, `$Path`, `$Metres`.
- Use a **protected** type when you want a hard abstraction boundary, or a guarantee that changing the internal representation will not affect external users. Examples: `$UserId`, `$OrderId`, `$Token`, `$Handle`.

Combine nominal and protected types with contexts and workflows to make safe domain-specific APIs.
