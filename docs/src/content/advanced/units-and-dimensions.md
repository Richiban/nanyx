> **Status: proposal.** Units of measure are not yet implemented. This page records the intended design and the questions that remain open; see [Open questions](#open-questions) at the end.

Nanyx will support units of measure for numeric types, allowing you to express time, sizes, and rates safely.

```nanyx
def lookback = 30d

def timeout = 3000ms

def maxFilesize = 50MB
```

This page defines the design direction for units, with two goals:

1. Unit-safe arithmetic with automatic unit derivation (for example `m / s -> m/s`)
2. Ergonomic value construction at call sites (for example `delay(500ms)`)

# Two concepts: dimensions and units

Nanyx should model **dimensions** and **units** separately:

- **Dimension**: the physical kind used by type checking (`Time`, `Length`, `Mass`, `Length/Time`)
- **Unit**: a named scale for a dimension (`ms`, `s`, `min`, `km`)

Type checking operates on dimensions. Units are syntax and conversion metadata for constructing and displaying values.

# Defining units

Units are always numeric in Nanyx. Unit declarations do not specify an underlying primitive type.

```nanyx
dimension Time
dimension Bytes
dimension Length

@baseUnit unit(m) Metres: Length

@baseUnit unit(s) Seconds: Time
unit(ms) Milliseconds: Time = 0.001s
unit(min) Minutes: Time = 60s
unit(hr) Hours: Time = 60min
unit(d) Days: Time = 24hr

@baseUnit unit(B) Byte: Bytes
unit(KB) Kilobyte: Bytes = 1024B
unit(MB) Megabyte: Bytes = 1024KB
```

## Base vs derived units

A dimension defines at least one base unit.

- A unit marked with `@baseUnit` is a base unit.
- A unit declared with `=` is a derived unit.
- `=` never defines a base unit; it always means “defined in terms of other units”.

Every derived unit must resolve through a finite chain to a base unit of the same dimension.

```nanyx
dimension Time

@baseUnit unit(s) Seconds: Time

unit(ms) Milliseconds: Time = 0.001s
unit(min) Minutes: Time = 60s
```

Whether a dimension may have more than one base unit (for example both `s` and `tick` for `Time`) is unresolved; see [Open questions](#open-questions).

Cycles are invalid and must be rejected by the compiler:

```nanyx
unit(a) A: Time = 2b
unit(b) B: Time = 3a
-- error: cyclic derived-unit definition (A -> B -> A)
```

## Design model

Each measured numeric type carries a compile-time _dimension vector_.

This page writes a measured type as `number(Dimension)`. Once the `Num(a)` numeric context lands, the dimension is expected to become a parameter on the concrete numeric type instead, for example `float(Time)` or `int(Bytes)`; the rules below are unaffected by that spelling.

- `number` is dimensionless (`1`)
- Base dimensions are independent (for example `Length`, `Time`, `Mass`)
- Units map to a scale within one dimension

Conceptually:

- `number(Length)` means a quantity of length
- `number(Time)` means a quantity of time
- `number(Length/Time)` is speed
- `number(Mass*Length/Time^2)` is force

The compiler stores normalized dimensions (sorted bases + integer exponents), so equivalent forms unify:

- `Length/Time` == `Length*Time^-1`
- `(Length/Time)*Time` == `Length`

# Derived units

```nanyx
def transferRate = 50(MB / s)
```

# Type rules (F#-style behavior)

Dimensions participate in type inference and unification, not runtime values.

For arithmetic operators on measured numeric values:

- `+` and `-` require identical dimensions
- `*` adds exponents (`d1 * d2`)
- `/` subtracts exponents (`d1 / d2`)
- `pow(x, n)` multiplies exponents by `n` (for integer `n`)

Examples:

```nanyx
def d = 100m
def t = 9.58s
def v = d / t      -- inferred: number(Length/Time)
def a = v / t      -- inferred: number(Length/Time^2)
```

Addition mismatch is rejected:

```nanyx
def bad = 10m + 2s
-- error: cannot add number(Length) and number(Time)
```

## Generic constraints over dimensions

Functions can stay generic over dimensions:

```nanyx
def square: number(d) -> number(d^2) = { x -> x * x }
def avgSpeed: (number(Length), number(Time)) -> number(Length/Time) = { dist, time -> dist / time }
```

This keeps APIs reusable while preserving dimension correctness.

# Conversion rules

Unit declarations define scale factors between units of the same dimension.

```nanyx
@baseUnit unit(s) Seconds: Time
unit(ms) Milliseconds: Time = 0.001s
unit(min) Minutes: Time = 60s
```

Conversions are compile-time checked and only allowed within equivalent dimensions:

```nanyx
def timeout: number(Time) = 500ms
def twoMinutes = 120s as min     -- explicit conversion syntax (proposed)
```

Invalid conversion is rejected:

```nanyx
def impossible = 1m as s
```

# Ergonomics for `delay(500ms)`

Use unit suffix literals as typed numeric constructors.

- `500ms` parses as numeric literal `500` with unit suffix `ms`
- Type is inferred as `number(Time)` (carrying source unit metadata for conversions/formatting)
- Works anywhere a numeric expression works

```nanyx
type Duration = number(Time)

def delay: Duration -> () = { d -> ... }

delay(500ms)      -- ok
delay(0.5s)       -- ok
delay(2min)       -- ok
delay(42)         -- error: expected Duration, found dimensionless number
```

# Function parameters: dimensions vs units

Both are useful, but they should mean different things.

- **Default**: functions accept a dimension (`number(Time)`, `number(Length/Time)`, etc.)
- **Optional strict mode**: functions can request an exact unit when protocol/interop requires it (for example milliseconds only)

Dimension-first API (recommended):

```nanyx
def delay: number(Time) -> () = { d -> ... }

delay(500ms)
delay(0.5s)
delay(2min)
```

Unit-specific API (proposed constraint form):

```nanyx
def setTimeoutRaw: number(Time) where unit = ms -> () = { d -> ... }

setTimeoutRaw(500ms)   -- ok
setTimeoutRaw(1s)      -- error (or require explicit `as ms`)
```

Recommendation: keep most APIs dimension-based, and reserve unit-specific parameters for boundaries (wire formats, hardware APIs, legacy contracts).

## Why this satisfies both goals

- Goal 1: unit algebra happens in inference/unification, so results derive automatically
- Goal 2: suffix literals construct measured values directly at call sites

# Runtime model

Dimensions and units are erased after type checking.

- Runtime carries only the underlying numeric representation
- No runtime penalty for unit checking
- Optional debug metadata can be emitted by tooling, not required by execution

# Open questions

The following need answers before this design can be implemented. They are listed in the order in which their answers constrain the rest.

1. **Where the scale lives.** If the unit is not part of the type, then `500ms + 1s` must be computed in a canonical unit, which means every literal is converted to a per-dimension base at compile time and the "source unit metadata" mentioned above is for display only. That in turn requires exactly one base unit per dimension, or a declared scale between any additional base units. The current text allows several base units with no relation between them, which cannot work.
2. **Integers.** `0.001s` and `1024B` mean conversions are not closed over `int`. If the canonical unit for `Time` is `s`, then `500ms` is `0.5` and every `Time` is a float. For integer-flavoured dimensions such as `Bytes` the base unit probably needs to be the smallest unit, with larger units as integer multiples.
3. **Interaction with `Num(a)`.** With `number` becoming a numeric context rather than a type, a measured value needs somewhere to carry its dimension. The likely answer is a dimension parameter on the concrete numeric type (`float(Time)`, `int(Bytes)`), which also gives a per-dimension answer to question 2.
4. **Type-level exponent arithmetic.** `number(d^2)` and `Length/Time^2` need integer exponents in the type language and unification that can solve equations such as `d * d = Length^2`. This is the largest implementation piece; Kennedy's "Types for Units-of-Measure" describes an algorithm that fits an HM-style checker.
5. **Lexing of suffix literals.** `100m` must be a single literal while `100 m` is not, `m` must not collide with an identifier in scope (such as an import alias), and the interaction with exponent notation (`1e5`) and underscores (`1_000ms`) needs stating.
