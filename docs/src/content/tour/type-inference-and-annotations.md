Type inference is foundational in Nanyx; type annotations very rarely _need_ to be written as the compiler infers types from values and usage. Annotations are, however, recommended for definitions exported from a module and _strongly_ recommended for definitions exported from a package.

# Inference by value

```nanyx
def message = "Hello world" -- inferred as string

def message: string = "Hello world" -- explicitly annotated
```

# Inference for functions

```nanyx
def add = { a, b -> a + b }
-- inferred as (int, int) -> int from the usage of `+` on `a` and `b`
```

Since functions conceptually have exactly one parameter, the parameter types are inferred from how the function is used. If the function is never called, or if the parameter types cannot be inferred from the body of the function, then the parameter types will be inferred as generic type variables, and the function will be inferred as a generic function:

```nanyx
def identity = { x -> x }
-- inferred as `a -> a`, meaning it can take any type `a` and returns the same type `a`
```

## Inferring tag unions

When the branches of an `if` or `match` evaluate to different [tags](./tags), the compiler does not pick one branch's type and reject the others. It collects the tags from every branch into a union, so a function that returns a tag per outcome needs no annotation:

```nanyx
def getMessage = {
  def message = "Hello, from Nanyx!"
  if false then #some(message)
  else #noMessage
}
-- inferred as `() -> #some(string) | #noMessage`
```

The same applies across the arms of a `match`:

```nanyx
def classify = { n ->
  match n
    | 0 -> #zero
    | 1 -> #one(n)
    | _ -> #many(n)
}
-- inferred as `int -> #zero | #one(int) | #many(int)`
```

Only tags are collected this way. Branches of other types still have to agree, so an `if` with an `int` in one branch and a `string` in the other is an error. Payloads are unified per tag, which means `#some(1)` in one branch and `#some("one")` in another is also an error, because a single `#some` cannot carry both.

An annotation still makes sense when you want the union fixed up front, for example to let a branch you have not written yet return a tag that no current branch produces:

```nanyx
def getMessage: () -> #some(string) | #noMessage | #error(string) = {
  if false then #some("Hello") else #noMessage
}
```

## Positional vs named inference

When functions are unannotated, Nanyx assumes that any deconstructed arguments are positional. If you want to use named parameters, annotate the function type:

```nanyx
-- Inferred as `(int, int) -> int` with positional parameters
def magnitude = { x, y -> math.sqrt(x * x + y * y) }
```

```nanyx
-- The annotation makes field names part of the function signature
def magnitude2: (x: int, y: int) -> float = { x, y -> math.sqrt(x * x + y * y) }
```

Field names in function signatures should be a deliberate choice, since callers must use the field names to call the function:

```nanyx
magnitude2(3, 4) -- ✗ This will not compile because the function expects named parameters

magnitude2(x = 3, y = 4) -- The correct way to call a function with named parameters
```

This is the one rule for named fields everywhere in the language: it applies equally when constructing a record from a type alias (see [Constructing records from a type alias](../tour/records#constructing-records-from-a-type-alias)), so `Point(x = 3, y = 4)` is correct and `Point(3, 4)` is an error for a type with named fields.

Also, when fields in a function signature are named--as with any kind of deconstruction--deconstruction must also be by name in the function body (although if the deconstructed names are the same as the field names, you can collapse `field = field` to just `field`):

```nanyx
def magnitude2: (x: int, y: int) -> float = { x, y -> math.sqrt(x * x + y * y) }

-- or 

def magnitude3: (x: int, y: int) -> float
    = { x = innerX, y = innerY -> 
        math.sqrt(innerX * innerX + innerY * innerY) 
    }
```

# Exported values

By convention, exported values should be annotated:

```nanyx
export def add = { a, b -> a + b }
-- Analyzer warning: missing type annotation

export def add: (int, int) -> int = { a, b -> a + b }
```

Although the language itself doesn't mandate this practice, the [official style analyzer](../standard-tools/official-analyzer) will emit a warning if this is not followed.

# Target typing

Nanyx can infer types based on how values are used:

```nanyx
def parse: string -> a = { json -> ... }

def obj = parse("{}")

def person: Person = obj
```

You can also use assertions to guide inference:

```nanyx
def obj = parse("..."): Person
```
