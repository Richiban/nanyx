This page covers core syntax and expression rules to help you read and write simple Nanyx code.

# Expressions

Everything is an expression that produces a value.

```nanyx
def message = "Hello world"
```

# Definitions

Use `def` to bind a name to a value. The value can be any expression, including another definition or a function:

```nanyx
def name = "Nanyx"
def version = 4
def getMessage = { name -> "Hello, {name}!" }
```

# Blocks and indentation

Blocks use indentation. A more-indented line belongs to the previous line. If a line ends with `->`, the next indented block is part of the expression.

```nanyx
def message =
  def preamble = "Hello"
  def audience = "World"

  "{preamble} {audience}"
```

You can also continue an expression on the next line when the previous line is incomplete:

```nanyx
def message = "Hello " +
  "World"
```

A block returns the value of its last expression:

```nanyx
def answer =
  def x = 20
  def y = 22
  x + y
```

For more on expression forms, see [Functions](../tour/functions) and [Pattern matching](../tour/pattern-matching).

# Numbers

Nanyx includes familiar numeric literals:

```nanyx
def count = 42
def ratio = 3.14159
def million = 1_000_000
```

You can use standard arithmetic and comparison operators:

```nanyx
def total = 10 + 5 * 2
def bigger = total > 12
```

For operator behavior, see [Operators](../tour/operators). For range syntax, see [Ranges](../tour/ranges).

# Strings

There are two kinds of string literal. Double-quoted strings support interpolation with `{...}`:

```nanyx
def name = "Alex"
def greeting = "Hello, {name}!"
```

Single-quoted strings are _raw_: nothing inside them is interpolated or escaped, so braces, backslashes and quotes are taken literally. Use them for JSON, regular expressions, templates, and anything else that contains braces of its own:

```nanyx
def json = '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}'
def emailPattern = '[^@]+@\w+\.\w+'
```

To write a literal brace inside a double-quoted string, double it:

```nanyx
def template = "Hello, {name}! Braces look like {{this}}."
```

For library string operations (`length`, `split`, `trim`, etc.), see [string stdlib](../stdlib/string).

# Equality and comparison

Use `==` and `!=` for equality and inequality:

```nanyx
def same = 10 == 10
def different = "a" != "b"
```

Use `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` for ordering comparisons:

```nanyx
def isAdult = 21 >= 18
```

Boolean values are combined with the keywords `and`, `or` and `not`:

```nanyx
def canVote = isAdult and isRegistered
def needsHelp = not isAdult or isNew
```

These operators are part of the language's operator system; see [Operators](../tour/operators) for details.

# Mutability

Mutability is available in Nanyx, but is considered a somewhat advanced feature. Read about [the Memory context](../advanced/memory) for more.

For immutable record updates, see [Copy and update (non-destructive mutation)](../tour/records#copy-and-update-non-destructive-mutation).

# Commas and newlines

You can use commas or newlines to separate items in lists and records:

```nanyx
def items = [1, 2, 3]

def items = [
  1
  2
  3
]

def myRecord = (a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)

def myRecord = (
  a = 1
  b = 2
  c = 3
)
```

# Comments

Single-line comments use `--`. Multi-line comments start and end with a line containing only three or more `---`.

```nanyx
-- This is a single-line comment

---
This is a multi-line comment.
---

----------------------------------
This is also a multi-line comment.
----------------------------------
```

Multi-line comments must be closed with the same number of dashes that they were opened with.

## Tags, ranges and records

Nanyx also supports tags, ranges, and records as core value forms. See [Tags](../tour/tags), [Ranges](../tour/ranges), and [Records and tuples](../tour/records).

# Table literals

Table literals are a shorthand for lists of records with the same shape:

```nanyx
def namesAndAges =
  [| name     | age |
   | "Alex"   | 22  |
   | "Taylor" | 30  |
   | "Sam"    | 28  |
   | "Morgan" | 45  |]
```

# Conditionals

`if` is an expression with a `then` branch and an `else` branch:

```nanyx
def label = if count == 0 then "empty" else "has items"

if cond then
  someCode()
else
  someOtherCode()
```

When there are more than two cases, use the multi-branch form. This is sugar for a `match` where each arm is a boolean condition, tested in order, with `else` as the final catch-all:

```nanyx
if | cond1 ->
     someCode()
   | cond2 ->
     someOtherCode()
   | else ->
     yetMoreCode()
```

`if` can also test a value against a pattern with `is`, as in `if get(3) is #some(v) then println("got {v}")`; see [Pattern matching](../tour/pattern-matching#if-matching).

# Unimplemented code

Use `???` as a placeholder to keep code compiling while you iterate:

```nanyx
def myFunction = { () -> ??? }
```
